Backgammon: The Optimal Strategy
 for the Pure Running Game
 Edward O. Thorp
 [Edward O. Thorp & Associates]
 Abstract. Thepurerunninggame(endgame,no-contact game) occurs in backgam
mon when no further contact between opposing men is possible. It compares roughly
 in importance to the end game in chess. This paper presents a complete exact so
lution to the pure running game with the doubling cube under the simplifying as
sumption (Model 1) that dice totals can be arbitrarily subdivided in moving men
 and that men can be borne o even though not all are in the inner table.
 The actual pure running game (i.e., without these simplifying assumptions) can
 be solved to high approximation by the methods of this paper. The strategies ob
tained are superior to those employed by the world’s best players.
 Our strategies and methods for the end game lead to substantially improved
 middle-game (where contact is still possible) play. It is feasible to find exact solutions
 to some middle-game situations. By also employing positional evaluation functions,
 it seems feasible to program an existing computer to become the world backgammon
 champion.
 1 Introduction
 The game of backgammon, along with chess and checkers, is among the old
est games known. A primitive backgammon-like game dated 2600 B.C. is on
 display in the British Museum (Jacoby and Crawford 1970, pp. 8–9).
 In place of the traditional board we use the equivalent representation of 26
 linearly ordered cells numbered 0,1,...,25. The traditional board corresponds
 to cells 1,...,24. White men travel from higher to lower numbered cells on
 White turns and Black men move in the opposite direction. To preserve the
 symmetry, we also use the coordinate systems i = Wi = B(25 i). See Figure
 1.
 The object of White is to move all men to W0 and the object of Black is
 to move all men to B0. The first player to get all men to his 0 cell wins. The

 men are initially as in Figure 1. The additional rules (see, e.g., Holland 1973,
 Hopper 1972, Jacoby and Crawford 1970, Lawrence 1973, Obolensky and
 James 1969, or Stern 1973) are assumed known to the reader and will be
 used, without a complete formal statement, as we proceed.
 [In Section 2 we give bounds for the duration of simplified models of the
 game. In Section 3 we give bounds for the number of board configurations.
 Section 4 gives a recursive solution to the Model 1 end game, i.e., the one
checker pure race model, and Section 5 extends this to Model 1, which adds
 the doubling cube. Section 6 discusses possible extensions of the research.]
 2 Duration of the game
 It is clear from Figure 1 that each player requires a minimum of 167 steps to
 bear o all his men. The expected number of steps on the first player’s first
 turn is 7; for each subsequent roll of the dice pair it is 8 1/6. Dividing 167 by
 8 1/6 gives 20.45 so it is plausible to suppose that the lower bound for the
 expected duration of the game might have order of magnitude 20.
 More precisely, let X1,X2,...,Xn,... be the totals rolled by the second
 player. The Xi are independent identically distributed random variables. Let
 M=167and let n be the least n such that X1+···+Xn M. Then E(n)
 is the expected time for player 2 to finish assuming no “interference” and no
 “waste” (i.e., Model 1, below). Thus E(n) 20.45 in this case and `a fortiori in
 the standard game. Similarly for the first player (E(m) 1)E(Xi)+7 M
 or E(m) 20.59. [Define the duration of the game to be min(m,n).]
 Note, however, that the expected duration of the standard game, or even of
 Model 1 below, could still be less than 20.45 because the game ends when
 either player finishes and in general E(min(m,n)) < min(E(m),E(n))
 for random variables m and n .
 Definition 1 (Model 1). The random walk idealization of the game assumes
 that two players (F and S for “first” and “second”) alternately roll the pair
 of dice. They start with totals of zero and accumulate points according to the
 outcomes of their rolls, valued as is done subsequent to the first roll of the
 actual game. The goal of F is a total N(F); that of S is N(S). The first
 player to accumulate a total which is greater than or equal to his goal wins.
 Model 1 omits several features of the game: (1) there is no blocking and
 no hitting of blots; in Model 1 opposing men can both occupy the same cell;
 the “flows” of opposing men do not interact; (2) there are no restrictions on
 bearing o in Model 1 whereas in the game all men not already borne o must
 be in the player’s home board before he can continue to bear o ; (3) Model 1
 allows the total to be arbitrarily subdivided for use in moving men whereas in
 the game each move of a man must be in a jump that uses the entire number
 on a die. For instance, rolling (5,3) the admissible jumps are 5 and 3. Rolling
 (4, 4) (“doubles”) they are 4, 4, 4, and 4.
240

 Model 1 may be played as a race between F and S, each on his own
 individual track. The tracks have N(F) + 1 and N(S) +1 cells, respectively.
 The initial configuration is a single man in cell 0 of each track. Players roll
 alternately, moving the total number of steps indicated by the dice. The first
 player to reach the last cell of his track wins.
 The expected duration E(D1) of the Model 1 game is a lower bound for
 the expected duration E(DG(s)) of the standard game G where s is any pair
 of strategies for Black and White. To see this, note that in Model 1 each
 roll of the dice is fully utilized in reducing the corresponding player’s pip
 count (pips needed to win) whereas in the standard game part or all of the
 roll of the dice may not be utilized. Reasons include blocked points and the
 possible waste of some of the roll in bearing o . Also the player on roll can
 hit the other player’s blots thereby increasing the other player’s pip count.
 Thus each Model 1 player’s pip count will always be less than or equal to the
 corresponding player’s standard game pip count so the Model 1 game will end
 no later than the standard game. So D1 DG(s) for each realization of the
 standard game hence E(D1) E(DG(s)) for all pairs of player strategies s.
 Model 1 corresponds to a random path on the lattice points of the non
negative quadrant with absorption at x = 167 (F wins) and at y = 167
 (S wins). The odd numbered steps are horizontal and to the right distances
 X1,X3,..., and the even numbered steps are vertically up distances Y2,Y4,...,
 where X1,X3,... and Y2,Y4,... are independent random variables distributed
 like the dice outcomes. A computer simulation will now readily yield a fairly
 accurate value of E(D1).
 What is the least number n of moves possible in the standard game? We
 know n 167/24 =7inthe Model 1 game because 24 points (double sixes)
 is the maximum per roll. (The symbol x , the “ceiling” of x, is the smallest
 integer k such that k x.) Hence 7 is a lower bound.
 To see that the game cannot end in 7 moves, consider a somewhat more
 realistic model.
 Definition 2 (Model 2). The no-contact model assumes the usual valuation
 of, and use of the outcomes of the rolls. Hence the men must move in jumps
 corresponding to the dice faces. This is the only di erence from Model 1. A
 board configuration and who has the move is specified. There are no stakes
 and no doubling cube. Men can be borne o even though not all have reached
 the inner table. Unlike Model 1, there may be “waste” when men are borne
 o : If a six is used to bear o a man from cell 5, the unused step cannot be
 applied to another man.
 Visualize Model 2 as a game where the players’ pieces are on two separate
 boards. Men then move as in the standard game except that not all men
 need to reach the inner table before men can be borne o . This can be an
 advantage. For instance suppose W has only two men, on W1 and W13.
 Now W rolls (6,1). He has a choice of W1 
W0 and W13 W7 or of
 W13 W6whereas in the standard game only the latter is allowed. But
Backgammon: The Optimal Strategy for the Pure Running Game
 241
 the configuration “one man on W7” is better than “men on W1,W6” in that
 n(W7) n(W1,W6) and strict inequality holds with positive probability.
 This will be proven (easily) later. For now, note that a roll of (5,2) bears o
 one man on W7 but with men on W1 and W6 it leaves a man on W1.
 In the preceding example, the Model 2 player upon rolling (6,1) had a
 choice as to whether to change {W1,W13} into {W0,W7} or into {W1,W6}
 and we saw that {W0,W7} was better. The game situations in which a player
 has a decision to make are “states.” The rule the player uses to make his
 choices in each state is his strategy.
 Definition 3. A configuration is an arrangement of the 15 White men and
 the 15 Black men on the extended board of 26 ordered cells. A position is a
 configuration and the specification of who has the doubling cube and what its
 value is. We always assume the initial stake is 1 unit. A state is a position
 and the specification of who is to move.
 [A configuration may be thought of as a photograph of the board without
 the doubling cube. Then a position is a photograph that also shows (the upper
 face of) the doubling cube.]
 The game can be unambiguously continued when the state is specified.
 Definition 4. A strategy for a player is a rule that specifies how the player
 is to move for each state of the game in which he is to move. For a given
 state the strategy may be pure or mixed. In a pure strategy the player always
 makes the same moves for a given roll. In a mixed strategy he chooses his
 moves for a given roll from among several alternatives, each having a specified
 probability of being chosen. Strategies also may be stationary or nonstationary.
 A stationary strategy is one which does not depend on the time (i.e., turn
 number). Each time a state repeats, a stationary strategy has the same rule
 for selecting moves. A stationary pure strategy selects exactly the same moves.
 Anonstationary strategy does depend on the time. A strategy pair s = (s1,s2)
 is a specification of strategies for players 1 and 2 respectively.
 We shall generally limit ourselves to stationary pure strategies in subse
quent sections. This is justified by the facts that (1) there is a strategy pair
 s =(s1,s2) such that s1 and s2 are optimal for the respective players (see von
 Neumann and Morgenstern 1964 for explanation of “optimal” and for proof)
 and (2) there is an optimal pair of pure strategies among the class of all pairs
 of optimal strategies.
 Proceeding as in the Model 1 case shows that (a) the expected duration
 E(D2) of Model 2 is less than or equal to E(DG); (b) for each sequence of rolls
 the Model 2 game ends at the same time or sooner than the corresponding
 standard game. Thus if L2 is the least number of turns in any Model 2 game
 and LG is the least for G, then L2 LG. Now count the number of jumps
 needed in Model 2 to bear o . Assuming the best case, all rolls (6,6), the
 number of jumps required for a (say) W man at coordinate x is x/6 , which
242
 Edward O. Thorp
 gives a total of 5+3·2+5·3+2·4 = 34. Thus LG L2 = 34/4 = 9 rolls.
 It is easy to prescribe sequences of rolls and strategies such that either B or
 W can win G in 9 moves. Therefore LG = 9.
 We have shown that E(D1) E(D2(s)) E(DG(s)). Note that strategies
 aren’t relevant for D1.
 Theorem 1. For any strategy pair s, E(D1) < E(D2(s)) < E(DG(s)).
 Proof. To show strict inequality, it su ces to give a finite sequence of rolls such
 that D1 < D2(s)foreach sandtogive asequence such that D2(s) < DG(s) for
 each s. If (6,5) is the opening roll and double sixes only are rolled thereafter,
 then D1 = 7 and D2(s) 9. If (6,5) is the opening roll and then double fives
 only are rolled, D2(s) = 11 but in G the men on 1, 6, 19, and 24 can never
 move so we can make DG(s) N for arbitrary N. 
In both Model 1 and Model 2 the length of the game is bounded above
 and the game trees are finite. The proof of the theorem shows this is not the
 case for G.
 Example 1. Aprime(ofplayer X)is 6 or moreconsecutive cells each “blocked,”
 or occupied, by two or more X men. Suppose F and S have all their men in
 adjacent primes, each separating the other from his 0 cell. If (6,6) is rolled
 forever by both players, no one moves and the game does not end.
 Table 1 gives an alternative “more active” example.

 This leads to the question of whether the expected duration of the game is

Backgammon: The Optimal Strategy for the Pure Running Game
 243
 Here, but for a gap, is a proof that the expected duration of the game is finite
 for arbitrary stationary strategies.2
 Assume first that the values of the doubling cube are limited to the finite
 set {2k, k = 0,1,...,n}. Then the number of possible states is finite. The
 absorbing states are those in which (a) all the men of the player who has just
 moved are in his 0 cell and not all the other player’s men are in his zero cell.
 The transition probability Pij from state i to state j depends only on the
 states i and j. The game is therefore a finite Markov chain with stationary
 transition probabilities. We conjecture (this is the gap in the proof) that all
 the other states are transient. It follows at once from this that the expected
 time to reach an absorbing state, and hence the expected duration of the
 game, is finite (e.g., Kemeny and Snell 1960, Theorem 3.1.1, p. 43.).
 If instead the possible doubling cube values increase without limit (2k, k =
 0, 1,2,...), the same proof works under the additional hypothesis that for
 su ciently large N, the strategy pair is the same for all k 
N. Then we
 group together all states that have k N and are otherwise the same. Now
 apply the preceding “proof.”
 3 The number of backgammon configurations
 We shall see that the number of possible configurations is enormous. Thus
 any attempt to solve the game by direct calculation would seem to be limited
 to parts of the end game. This does not, however, rule out solutions to larger
 portions of the game via theorem proving, or by e cient algorithms. Such
 solutions might be exact, approximate, or involve inequalities.
 Some configurations cannot arise in the course of the game. The rules
 specify that no one of cells 1,2,...,24 can contain both Black and White
 men. The rules also specify that the game ends when one player’s men are in
 his 0-cell, therefore the configuration where each player has all his men in his
 0-cell is impossible.
 The impossibility of other configurations may be deduced. For instance,
 suppose all men are on the bar. Whoever just moved had to, by the rules,
 attempt (successfully in this case) to move a man or men o the bar. This
 is a contradiction. As a more complex illustration, suppose both players have
 men on the bar and have primes on their own home boards. What happened
 on the last move? The player whose move it was had men on the bar and
 2 Editor’s note: The gap can be filled. A standard result in Markov chains is that if state
 i is recurrent and leads to state j in a finite number of steps with positive probability,
 then state j is recurrent and leads back to state i in a finite number of steps with positive
 probability. In particular, if every nonabsorbing state leads to an absorbing state in a finite
 number of steps with positive probability, then the conjecture that every nonabsorbing
 state is transient is correct. So all that needs to be verified is that from any state there
 is a finite sequence of dice rolls that leads to one player or the other winning the game,
 assuming the specified strategy. This requires a bit of thought but can be verified to be
 correct.

 attempted to move them. He did not succeed since his opponent had a prime
 after the move, hence before. Therefore the configuration did not change. By
 induction, the board configuration was always thus, contradicting the initial
 configuration specified in the rules. Hence these configurations are impossible.
 If we know who has just moved, additional configurations are impossible.
 For instance, a player cannot complete his turn with all his men on the bar
 when the opponent has no blocked points on his home board.
 Some questions about possible configurations: Suppose W has i men on
 the bar, B has j men on the bar, and X (= W or B) is to move. Describe
 this by (i,j;X). Which (i,j;X) can arise in the course of the game? In par
ticular what are the maximal such triples (i,j;W) and (i,j;B)? Presumably
 all submaximal triples can also arise.
 [Following a suggestion of the referee we find a simple upper bound for the
 number of configurations. Using the fact that the number of ways of placing
 r balls in n ordered cells is r+n 1
 r
 men in the 26 cells {0,...,25} in 40
 (Feller 1968), we can place the 15 B
 15 ways. The same is true for the 15 W
 men. This includes all the possible configurations plus some impossible ones,
 such as those with B and W men in the same cell. The resulting number
 M= 40
 15
 2 1.62 1023 is an upper bound for the number of configurations.
 Using the rule that opposing men may not occupy the same cell reduces
 this somewhat. The bound given in the original paper, via a more complex
 combinatorial calculation, was about 1.85 1019.]3
 An upper bound for the number of states, assuming a limit of n values for
 the doubling cube and initial stakes of one unit, is then 2Mn.
 We turn now to the important special case of the pure running game.
 Definition 5. The pure running game (or end game or no-contact game) is
 that portion of the game where no further contact between men is possible, i.e.,
 when there exists a real number x such that all W men have coordinates less
 than x and all B men have coordinates greater than x. (Here all coordinates
 are W coordinates.)
 The end game is finite and cannot take more than 63 moves for W, 62 for
 B. This case occurs if x = 12.5, all 15 B men are on 13, all 15 W men are
 on 12, the only subsequent rolls are (1,2) and B and W assemble all 15 men
 on B1 and W1 respectively, before bearing o . It follows that the game tree
 arising from each initial end-game position is finite.
 To get an upper bound K for the number of end-game configurations,
 relabel the cells 1,...,26.

 The three factors correspond to the number of ways to choose the i cells occupied by
 W, the number of ways to place the 15 W men in these i cells with at least one in each,
 and the number of ways to distribute the 15 B men into the remaining 26 i cells.

 To start the recursion, refer to Figures 2 and 3 and note that for zone
 (a1) E(i,j;W) = 1 for i = 1,2,3. Then to find values for zone (b1) we use
 (2) to find E(i,j;B) for i = 1,2,3. Next to find values for zone (a2) calculate
 E(i,j;W) for i = 4,5,6, then for zone (b2) find E(i,j;B) for i = 4,5,6, etc.
 The matrices of values are readily determined with the aid of a computer.
 The matrices will satisfy (error checks)
 • |E(i,j;X)| 1 (the maximum gain or loss is 1)
 • E(i,j;W) = E(j,i;B) (antisymmetry)
 • E(i,j;W) E(i,j;B) (it is better for White if White is to move)
 • E(i,j;X) E(i+m,j;X), m 0 (it is better for White to be closer to
 his goal)
 • E(i,j;X) E(i,j+n;X),n 0(itisbetterfor White if Black has farther
 to go).

 Then E(i,j;W) is calculated recursively by finding (1) the first three rows, (2)
 the first three columns, (3) the next three rows, (4) the next three columns,
 etc.
 We calculated E(i,j;W) recursively to four places (some roundo error in
 fourth place) by equations (1) and (2) for all i and j such that 1 i,j 168.
 The calculation is extremely fast. Tables 2 and 3 show results rounded to two
 places. Table 4 shows a portion of the full table from which Tables 2 and 3
 were extracted. [The rows and columns of Tables 2–4 vary monotonically so
 values not given can be obtained by interpolation or extrapolation.]
 An alternative to the recursion calculation is to simulate a large number
 of Model 1 games on a computer, to determine the matrices of Figures 2 and
 3. Equivalently we can determine the matrix (P(i,j;F)) of probabilities that
 the first player F will win given that his goal is i and that the goal of the
 second player S is j. Such a matrix is computed for selected (i,j) and given
 as Table 5. Note that an exact (P(i,j;F)) matrix follows from Table 2 and
 the equation P(i,j;F) = (E(i,j;F) + 1)/2.
 The entries in Table 5 are each based on n = 10,000 games. The stan
dard deviation of the sample mean from the true mean p = P(i,j;F) is
 p(1 p)/n 0.005 so the third digit is in doubt. For large (i,j), simulation
 is a useful alternative to the recursion method. It provides values for a speci
f

 pairs with i

 of the actual game for F is positive. Note, however, that in the actual game
 E(X) =7for the initial roll rather than the 8 1/6 of subsequent rolls, whereas
 Tables 2, 3, and 5 assume 8 1/6 for all rolls. (This last is reasonable because
 Model 1 is meant to represent the end game.) Examination of the full Tables 2
 and 3 suggests that changing the initial roll to conform with the actual game
 would reduce the F win probability to about .542, giving a value of .084 to
 E.
 However, we cannot make useful inferences from this about the value (as
suming both players choose optimal strategies) of the actual game to F. The
 additional features of the actual game make it substantially di erent from
 Model 1. Hitting blots, loss of some or all of a roll when men are su ciently
 blocked, and “wastage” all tend to make N(F) and N(S) substantially greater
 than in Model 1. However, symmetry shows that p = P(i,i;W) > .50 for
 i 
1. Thus we might conjecture that the probability p that F wins satisfies
 .55 > p > .50 whence the value V(F) of the game to F (without doubling or
 gammons) would satisfy .10 > V(F) > 0.
 Doubling and gammons both should alter this considerably. If X doubles
 and Y folds it is an ordinary win. In scoring the actual game, there are three
 cases if no one folds. If X wins and some Y men have reached Y0 it is an
 ordinary win and X receives the value on the cube. If no Y men have reached
 Y0 and all Y men are in cells Y1 through Y18 it is a gammon and X gets
 twice the value on the cube. If no Y men have reached Y0 and some Y men
Backgammon: The Optimal Strategy for the Pure Running Game
 253
 are in Y19 through Y25 it is a backgammon and X receives three times the
 value on the cube.
 Even without doubling or gammons, V(F) is not easy to judge. We can’t
 even tell if V (F) > 0. For instance, Cooke and Bradshaw (1974) classify
 initial rolls according to how good they judge them to be. There is fairly
 general agreement on the approximate classification and as to whether initial
 rolls are good or bad. The good rolls for F are 3-1, 4-2, and 6-1 which have
 joint probability 6/30, since the initial F roll in the actual game cannot be
 doubles. For the second player all first rolls of doubles, except double fives, are
 also good to very good, for a probability of 11/36 that S begins with a good
 roll. Thus the advantage of the initial roll is o set. But how much? Could the
 value of the game even be positive for the second player?
 5 Solution to the Model 1 end game
 We extend the method to solving Model 1, which we define as Model 1 ex
tended to incorporate the doubling cube. The doubling cube is the most in
teresting, subtle, and least understood aspect of the game. Here for the first
 time we will learn things contrary to the beliefs of most players.
 Either player may make the initial double. If one player doubles, the other
 player may accept or fold. If he accepts, the game continues for doubled stakes
 and the player who accepted now possesses the doubling cube, i.e., is the only
 player who can make the next (re)double. This must be done just prior to his
 roll by the player who possesses the cube. If the doubled or redoubled player
 folds, he loses the current stake prior to the double.
 The states for Model 1 are described by six lattices, (i,j;X), (i,j;X,D),
 and (i,j;X,O), where X = W or B. If the last coordinate is X, no one has
 yet doubled and therefore no one has the cube. If the last coordinate is D the
 player who is to move has the doubling cube; if it is O the other player has it.
 The moves of the game, i.e., the allowable transformations (between lattices),
 are:
 a. given W
 White doubles: (i,j;W) to (max(i k,0),j;B,D)
 White does not double: (i,j;W) to (max(i k,0),j;B)
 b. given B
 Black doubles: (i,j;B) to (i,max(j k,0);W,D)
 Black does not double: (i,j;B) to (i,max(j k,0);W)
 c. given W,D
 White doubles: (i,j;W,D) to (max(i k,0),j;B,D) or
 White does not double: (i,j;W,D) to (max(i k,0),j;B,O)
 d. given W,O

 (i, j; B,O) to (i,max(j k,0);W,D)
 We calculate the expectation for White per unit currently (i.e., at point
 i, j) bet. A decision to double is made by comparing the expectation from
 doubling, per current unit, with that from not doubling. The expectation, if
 positive, is increased by doubling and decreased by the loss of the doubling
 cube. Thus whether to double will depend in general on the results of each cal
culation. In case (a), White’s expectation if he doubles is ED ED(i,j;W) =
 min(1,ED), where ED(i,j;W) = 2 kE(max(i k,0),j;B,D)A(k), and his
 expectation if he does not double is
 E0(i,j;W) = 
E(max(i k,0),j;B)A(k).
 k
 In case (c) White’s expectation if he doubles is
 ED ED(i,j;W,D)=min 1,ED(i,j;W,D) ,
 where
 ED(i,j;W,D) = 2
 E(max(i k,0),j;B,D)A(k),
 k
 and if he does not double, his expectation is
 E0(i,j;W,D) = 
E(max(i k,0),j;B,O)A(k).
 k
 We assume each player’s goal is to maximize his own expectation. Then
 in cases (a) and (c) White should double if ED > E0, in which case we assign
 the value ED to E(i,j;W) or E(i,j;W,D). He is indi erent if ED = E0 and
 he should not double if ED < E0. In these cases we set E(i,j;W) = E0. Black
 should accept a double if ED = ED < 1, he is indi erent if ED = ED = 1, and
 should fold if ED > 1. Let A(i,j) = {m,n} stand for these alternatives, where
 m =0,1,2 according to whether White should not double, is indi erent, or
 should double, and n = 0,1,2 according to whether Black if doubled should
 fold, be indi erent, or accept a double. Then for cases (a) and (c) we record
 the A(i,j) strategy matrices as the E matrices are calculated.
 In case (d) White cannot double so
 E(i,j;W,O) =
 E(max(i k,0),j;B,D)A(k).
 k
 The E matrices for Black to move are useful auxiliaries in the recursion but
 they can be deduced from those for White to move. This follows, just as in
 Model 1, from the analogous antisymmetries for Model 1:
Backgammon: The Optimal Strategy for the Pure Running Game
 255
 E(i,j;W) = E(j,i;B),
 E(i,j;W,D) = E(j,i;B,D),
 E(i,j;W,O) = E(j,i;B,O).

 E(i,j;B) = min(E0,ED),

 It is persuasive that it is at least as good, and generally better, to possess
 the doubling cube than not to. This ought to be true in the standard game as
 well as in the various simpler models we discuss. This is generally taken for
 granted by players but a formal proof remains to be given.
 We give a proof for Model 1, in which case it is equivalent to the simul
taneous inequalities
 E(i,j;W,D) E(i,j;W) E(i,j;W,O)
 E(i,j;B,D) E(i,j;B) E(i,j;B,O)

 Theorem 2. Inequalities (7) and (8) hold for Model 1, i.e., it is always at
 least as good to have the doubling cube as not to.

 Proof. For i = 1,2,3 all parts of (7) are 1. This corresponds to zone (a1) of Fig
ure 2, in each of the lattices {(i,j;W,D)}, {(i,j;W)}, and {(i,j;W,O)}. Now
 let i = 1,2,3 and suppose Black follows the (not necessarily optimal) strat
egy of not doubling when in states (i,j;B,D) or (i,j;B). Then his expecta
tion is, respectively, 
k E(i,max(j k,0);W,O)A(k) or 
k E(i,max(j
 k, 0);W)A(k), whereas the expectation of a Black player in state (i,j;B,O) is
 k E(i,max(j k,0);W,D)A(k). Comparing term by term and using what
 was proved about “zone (a1)” establishes (8) for i = 1,2,3, i.e., for the regions
 of (i,j;B,y), y = D or blank or O, corresponding to zone (b1) of Figure 3.
 We continue with zone (a2), zone (b2), etc. just as in the original recursion.
 This concludes the proof. 
The player who is doubled should accept the double if as a result his
 expectation E > 1, he is indi erent if E = 1, and he should reject the
 double if E < 1. In this last instance the game ends and the other player
 receives +1 so this value, not E, is assigned to the appropriate state for
 use in subsequent recursions. Thus for each state in each of the matrices
 {(i, j; W,D)} and {(i,j;B,D)} we compute ED and E0. Then we will list
 whether the player doubles ( 1 = NO, 0 = INDIFF, +1 = YES), whether
 the doubled player accepts ( 1 = NO, 0 = INDIFF, +1 = YES), and the
 expectation E.
 Tables 6 and 7 are selected portions of four-place tables for E(i,j;W,D)
 and E(i,j;W,O), respectively. [A comparison of corresponding entries in the
 two tables shows the enormous value of the doubling cube.]
 As a check, the various Model 1 tables were shown to satisfy (4), (5), (6),
 (7), (8) as well as monotonicity:
 E(i,j;X,Y ) E(i+k,j;X,Y)
 E(i,j;X,Y ) E(i,j +k;X,Y).
 and that a player with three or less steps wins on the next move:
 E(i,j;W,Y ) = 1 if i = 1,2,3
 E(i,j;B,Y ) = 1 if j = 1,2,3.
 As a further test we have:
 (9)
 (10)
 (11)
 (12)
 Lemma 1. If 0 < E(i,j;W,O) < 1/2, then E(i,j;W,D) 2E(i,j;W,O)
 and W should double.
 Proof. If W cannot double, the next state will be of the form (m,n;B,D). If
 W can and does double, the next state will also be of this form with the same
 probabilities of m,n. Thus W gets 0 < E(i,j;W,O) < 2E(i,j;W,O) < 1 by
 doubling.
 However (W,D) can choose not to double in which case the next state
 is (m,n;B,O). It can and does happen that this sometimes gains more (see
 Tables 6 and 7 for many (i,j) examples) hence E(i,j;W,D) > 2E(i,j;W,O)
 may occur.
Backgammon: The Optimal Strategy for the Pure Running Game
 257
 The optimal strategies were computed directly as previously described.
 However an optimal strategy can be derived from the E tables. To illustrate,
 we do this using Tables 6 and 7 for the case when White has the doubling cube
 and is to move. The procedure is to analyze cases (let E(i,j;W,D) = ED,
 E(i,j;W,O) = EO), as in Table 8.
 Applying these cases to Table 6 produces the shaded area. It also is another
 check on the tables.
 Keeler and Spencer (1975) approach the Model 1 problem by replacing
 the actual dice with a random variable having values 5, 10, and 20 with
 probabilities .55, .36, and .09. (The text suggests that their Model 1 simulation
 also used this simplification. However the di erence in probabilities between
 Table 6 and 7 suggests otherwise.) These probabilities are “... set to make
 the mean = 8 1/6 and the variance = 19, which are the real backgammon
 values.” Actually the correct variance is 18.47
 2. This comes from the formula
 ( ix2
 i n
 x2)/n. The incorrect value 19 arises for the actual dice if one uses
 the formula ( ix2
 i n
 x2)/(n 1), which is the appropriate formula for the
 di erent situation of independent sampling from a population whose mean is
 unknown.
 Replacing the actual dice by the “5, 10, 20” dice greatly simplifies the
 problem: only (i,j) multiples of 5 need to be considered. Thus 170 170
 matrices become 34 34 matrices. The matrix storage sizes are reduced by a
 factor of 25. Also the recursion to calculate each entry involves sums of only
 three terms, rather than 14 so we have another reduction by a factor of almost
 5. Thus the total calculation is reduced by a factor of more than 100. Yet the
 Keeler–Spencer results are an excellent approximation.
 For instance the probabilities for equal counts in their Table 2 are o by
 at most one in the second place. When the opponent has 5 more points they
 are within 2 in the second place (all the errors here are overestimates). When
 the opponent has 10 more points their figures overestimate by 1 to 4 in the
 second place.
 The correct Model 1 strategy for doubling, redoubling, and folding, has a
 somewhat irregular pattern. Gillogly and Keeler (1975) give a simplified rule
 based, presumably, on the Keeler–Spencer calculations:
 Approximate rule (Gillogly–Keeler): With pip count C let D = C if C 25
 and D =1.1C if C >25. Then make the first double if the opponent’s count
 j 
D 2.Redouble if j D 1. The opponent should fold if (doubled and)
 j 
D+2.
 Prior to this paper, Keeler and Spencer (1975), and Gillogly and Keeler
 (1975), the rule recommended by experts is the one given by Jacoby and
 Crawford (1970):
 Approximate rule (Jacoby–Crawford): With a pip count of C double if
 j 
1.075C; redouble if j 1.1C; the opponent should fold if j 1.15C.
 Obolensky and James (1969) gives no rule; Lawrence (1973) and Genud
 (1975) repeat the rule without acknowledgment (a common practice in gaming
 circles). Stern (1973) gives a complex and unclear set of maxims.

 Doubling gives the opponent the chance to err; not doubling does not, so if
 both are optimal doubling is recommended.
 Both the J–C and G–K strategies are quite close to the exact results for
 Model 1. Note that in the actual game the e ective i and j will tend to
 be greater than the pip counts, due to “wastage” in bearing o . This tends
 to slightly increase the double, redouble and fold numbers in Table 5.3. We
 expect subsequent more realistic calculations to give an increase of 1 just
 before some of the change-over points. For instance, when W has 43 White
 might redouble at 5 instead of 4 and Black might wait until 8 to fold instead
 of 7. Of course the use of the corrected count (Section 6, below) is a more
 precise way to incorporate this wastage e ect.
 Table 9 compares the approximate rules with the exact results if 1 
C 65, for the case when White redoubles and Black considers accepting or
 folding. This region of small C is the most irregular, and even here the G–K
 approximate rule is generally good.
 For fixed White count i, let Di be the least Black count j for which White
 should double. Let Ri be the least Black count for which White should re
double, and let Fi be the least Black count for which White should fold. It is
 plausible to expect the Di Ri Fi for all i. The last inequality corresponds
 to the obvious fact that there is nothing (i.e., no expectation) to be gained by
 folding without being redoubled. Similarly we prove Di Fi. Note however
 that if a player’s expectation is 1, whence he has no probability of winning
 he may as well fold voluntarily to save time unless his opponent is a far from
 optimal player.
 This establishes the first part of the following theorem.

 (b) White redoubles whenever he gains and does as he pleases when he is
 indi erent. He doubles whenever he gains or is indi erent.
 Proof. Note first that the qualifications (a) or (b) are needed because in gen
eral the optimal strategies are not unique. For doubling, redoubling, and fold
ing there are lower and upper numbers, Di Di, Ri Ri, and Fi Fi,
 such that the player is indi erent if and only if Di j < Di, etc. If these
 indi erence zones overlap, there exist optimal strategies which violate one or

 This concludes the proof of the theorem.
Backgammon: The Optimal Strategy for the Pure Running Game
 263
 An ambiguity that appears frequently in the previous work (e.g., in Ja
coby and Crawford 1970, Gillogly and Keeler 1975) is to give the doubling,
 redoubling, and folding thresholds in terms of the probability of winning by
 the player who is to move. For example Gillogly and Keeler say that the prob
ability of winning with i = j = 30 is .65, and that the cuto s for D,R,F are
 respectively probabilities of .65, .69, 75. It seems clear from their text and
 from comparison with our results that they mean Model 1 probabilities. Note
 that the Model 1 probabilities of winning with optimal strategies will in gen
eral be di erent, and may even be multi-valued because they depend on the
 player’s choice of strategy, and even the optimal strategies may be nonunique.
 In general, the probability of winning may depend strongly on strategy. As an
 extreme example to make the point, suppose in an actual game both Black
 and White always double. White always accepts if doubled, but Black always
 folds. Then the probability is one that White wins.
 As an instance from the actual game, suppose White has only one man
 left, on W6 and Black has only one man left, on B3. White is to move and
 has the cube. Then E(6,3;W) = 1/2 (Model 1) because the probability W
 wins in the next roll is 3/4. Otherwise Black wins.
 White should double, giving
 ED = 1. Then if Black plays optimally, he
 is indi erent as to whether he accepts or folds because in either case his ex
pectation is 1. Suppose Black (by means of a chance device) accepts with
 probability p and folds with probability 1 p. Then he wins the game with
 probability p/4, and White wins with probability 1 p/4, 0 p 1. Hence,
 even though both players choose an optimal strategy, the White win proba
bility may assume any value from .75 to 1 depending on the Black choice of
 optimal strategy. It follows that (a) optimal strategies are nonunique in all
 the versions of the game which we consider, (b) for any position which can
 lead to the above position, this is also true, and (c) in all versions of the game
 that we consider, for any position that can lead to the above position (i.e., in
 “most” positions), the win probability is not uniquely determined even if the
 players limit themselves to optimal strategies.
 6 Pending research
 In a future paper we plan to present exact strategies for bearing o . With these
 we shall extend the results to Model 2, Model 2 (= Model 2 plus doubling
 cube), Model 3 (Model 2 with bearing o allowed only when all men have
 reached the inner board), and Model 3 (Model 3 with the doubling cube).
 Model 3 is the pure running game with the actual rules. The solutions involve
 relatively minor corrections or “perturbations” of the Model 1 and Model 1
 solutions. For instance, Gillogly and Keeler (1975) give approximate rules for
 estimating the “wastage” of an inner board position. This is the amount that
 should be added to the (Model 1, 1) pip count i due to the fact that in Models
 3 and 3 some parts of the dice counts may be wasted in bearing o .
264
 Edward O. Thorp
 Approximate rule for wastage (Gillogly–Keeler): Suppose all n men are on
 the inner board and cover m points. Let k men be on the one point. Then
 add w to i where w = k+(n 1)+(n m).
 Thus there are penalties for men on the one point, for extra men, and for
 extra men clustered on a point.
 The rule is not used consistently by its authors. In one example they
 compare 5 men on the 6 point with 10 men on the one point. The wastage is
 8 for the 5 men on the 6 point and 28 for the 10 men on the one point. The
 adjusted count should be i = j = 38. But in the text only the di erence of 20
 is added to j, giving i = j = 30. In our opinion, their “netting out” method
 is not a correct application of their rule.
 The methods of this paper apply mutatis mutandis to numerous variants
 of the game (Bell 1969). Some earlier forms of the game coincide with Models
 1 or 1 and are thus completely solved.
 I wish to thank Steven Mizusawa for his programming of the computations
 in this paper.
 [Author’s afterword: This article was reported on in Thompson (1975)
 and Thorp (1975). The exact solution to a special case of Model 3, the
 pure running game with the doubling cube, where each player has borne
 o all but just one or two men in their home boards, appeared in Thorp
 (1978a,b,c), and was reprinted in Thorp (1984). The exact Model 3 solu
tion to pure races when each player is bearing o from his home board has
 since been computed for hundreds of millions of cases, including up to 9
 men for each player, by Hugh Sconyers, a two-time world team backgammon
 player. See http://www.back-gammon.info/sconyers/hypergammon.html.
 Zadeh and Kobliska (1977) published an important article on optimal dou
